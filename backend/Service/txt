3. Data Flow
Data flows from the user interface (Frontend) to the backend services (Backend), which interact with the SQL Server database (DataAccess) for task and user management. The Frontend captures user actions and sends requests to the Backend, which processes the requests and interacts with the DataAccess layer to perform CRUD operations on the database.

4. Common Functionalities
- User Authentication: Validate user credentials during login.
- Task Management: Create, edit, delete, and view tasks.
- Data Validation: Ensure all required fields are properly filled before performing operations.
- Error Handling: Display appropriate error messages for invalid operations.
